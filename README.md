Predict which shoppers will become repeat buyers
=================================================

Consumer brands often offer discounts to attract new shoppers to buy their products.
The most valuable customers are those who return after this initial incented purchase.
With enough purchase history, it is possible to predict which shoppers, when presented an offer,
will buy a new item. However, identifying the shopper who will become a loyal buyer -- prior
 to the initial purchase -- is a more challenging task.
